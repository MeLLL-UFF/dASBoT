 * Class responsable for create the Expamsion Answer Set based on a example by a

 * Exampansion Answer Set of the whole program but based on a single example.
 * This technique make the process faster, the rule to be generate next must be
 * for this example, instead.
 * <br> This class's performance can be dramatically improved by giving a
 * {@link IndividualTemplate} to typify the individuals from the problem.
